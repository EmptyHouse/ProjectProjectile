Philia|Hello! My name is Philia. I am the princess of this town and I demand you give me directions!
Maid|Oh princess. You are even cuter than the pictures depict.
Philia|Your princess is not cute. Now tell me how to get to the top of the mountain, peasant.
Maid|Oh sweetheart you can't just climb the mountain. Many have died trying. You'll need something more. Perhaps a magical item from the deeper ends of the forest.
Philia|Thank you maid. Your services are most appreciated.
Maid|Did you want any tea and cookies before you go on your scary adventure m'lady?
Philia|I.... yes please.
